  <!-- Control how country name changes work in conjunction with player name changes.
  0 disables country name changes, and you may change your player name via the Multiplayer Lobby. (Default SP2 V1.5.1)
  1 allows you to change your country name via the Covert Actions New Cell window. In the name text box, type "NAME", followed by a space, followed by your desired country name, and click "Create"; instead of creating a new cell, your country name will change. For example, if you type "NAME This is my new country name", then your country name will change to "This is my new country name". You may change your player name via the Game Lobby window. However, if you have the Game Lobby open at the same time that someone, including you, changes country name, then your player name will reset to what you specified in your Game Options. (Default SP2-HDM V6 and earlier)
  2 allows you to change your country name via the Covert Actions New Cell window, as in 1. You may change your player name via the Game Lobby, but only before you enter the game. After you enter the game, you may change your player name via the New Cell window in the same way as country name, but with "PLAYER" and a space before your desired player name, instead of "NAME" and a space. For example, if you type "PLAYER Player One", then your player name will change to "Player One". When you are in the game, your Game Lobby name text box may display your Game Options player name, but your current player name will display correctly in chat.
